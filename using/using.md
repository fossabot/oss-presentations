# Using Open Source Software

<!--markdownlint-disable MD035-->

---

## Question

* What is Open Source Software?
  * Definitions
  * Licences
* Why should we be using it for development purposes?
  * Challenge: build a WebApp in the next 15 minutes
  * Software Engineering Economics (Stephen Walli)
    * Don't start from a blank page
    * Speeds up your development by focussing on the added value, specific to your needs
    * That's how we've been working in the past but we need to be better at it.
  * Build on top of of giants (and smaller geniuses as well)
* How can we use Open Source Software properly?
  * Security
  * Compliance

## Copyright & Licences

Software licences give you certain rights and conditions

---

## Open Source Software

>Software available under an open source licence.

For the purpose of the Government of Canada, we consider the Open Source Initiative's [definition](https://opensource.org/docs/definition.php) of open source as an industry standard.

------

## Basic Rights

1. Use the software as you wish
2. Study the source code
3. Modify the source code
4. Redistribute the software

------

## Conditions

1. Notice
2. Derived works

------

## It's not open source

If you only have access to the source code.

_You **must** have the rights based on the open source definition through an open source licence._

---

## Types of Open Source Licences

Permissive:

>Allow you to do pretty much what you want with it and distribute it under different conditions than you obtained it.

Reciprocal:

>Allow you to do pretty much the same but require you to redistribute on the same conditions under which you obtained it.

---

## First Challenge

Identify:

* 1 Permissive licence
* 1 Reciprocal licence

Explain their main differences using [TL;DR Legal](https://tldrlegal.com/)

vs

_Outbound_

------

The terms and conditions under which you will be distributing your software must not exceed the terms and conditions associated with the licences of the software you will be using in your project.
