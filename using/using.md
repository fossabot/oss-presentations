# Using Open Source Software

<!--markdownlint-disable MD035-->

## Question

* What is Open Source Software?
  * Definitions
  * Licences
* Why should we be using it for development purposes?
  * Challenge: build a WebApp in the next 15 minutes
  * Software Engineering Economics (Stephen Walli)
    * Don't start from a blank page
    * Speeds up your development by focussing on the added value, specific to your needs
    * That's how we've been working in the past but we need to be better at it.
  * Build on top of of giants (and smaller geniuses as well)
* How can we use Open Source Software properly?
  * Security
  * Compliance

## Algorithm

>"A procedure for solving a mathematical problem [...] in a finite number of steps that frequently involves repetition of an operation"

>**Broadly**: "A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end"[^fn]

## Source Code

>Source code is the version of a computer program as it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer) by a human in a programming language.[^fn]

## Copyright & Licences

Software licences give you certain rights and conditions

Microsoft did a 180 degree
## Open Source Software

>Software available under an open source licence.

For the purpose of the Government of Canada, we consider the Open Source Initiative's [definition](https://opensource.org/docs/definition.php) of open source as an industry standard.

------

## Basic Rights

1. Use the software as you wish
2. Study the source code
3. Modify the source code
4. Redistribute the software

------

## Conditions

1. Notice
2. Derived works

------

## It's not open source

If you only have access to the source code.

_You **must** have the rights based on the open source definition through an open source licence._

---

## Types of Open Source Licences

Permissive:

>Allow you to do pretty much what you want with it and distribute it under different conditions than you obtained it.

Reciprocal:

>Allow you to do pretty much the same but require you to redistribute on the same conditions under which you obtained it.

## First Challenge

Choose an Open Source Licence:

* MIT License (Expat)
* Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)
* BSD 3-Clause License (Revised)
* Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)
* GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3)
* GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)

## Why

It's in the Directive on Management of IT

------

* Don't start with a blank canvas, focus on the added value
* Speed up development time by reusing existing solutions to common problems
* Leverage a large community of peers to enhance quality and for wider maintenance
* Build on top of giants' shoulders and communities

>If you want to be at the top of the world, you have to start there.
