<!--markdownlint-disable MD035-->

* Why would you publish your project?
  * Aligned with our vision of working in the open
  * In line with the Directive
  * Find allies in places you did not think of (cities, provinces, civic society, private sector)
  * Find new usage for your software
    * AIA: Could be reused for Enterprise architecture assessments
  * Adopt best practices in development
    * Working in the open, you know other people will be able to see your code.
      * People are more prone to take the time to write better code.
* How can you do it?
  * Compliance
    * Choose your licence based on your desired outcome
    * Choose your licence based on the components you will be leveraging
  * Security
    * 2FA
    * Hash
  * Governance
    * It is still your project
    * Need a clear set of expectations as to how development will be done
  * Community
    * Working in the open may lead to others wanting to contribute
    * Need to set expections as to what is accepted
    * Code of conduct

Let's start by creating a repository and uploading your project.

------

Add a licence of your choice.

Which did you pick and why?

---

## Crown Copyright

Technically, the work we do in the office is Crown Copyright, belongs to Her Majesty in right of Canada.

------

## Licence

The licence you choose has to be applied by someone with the delegated authority from the Crown.

Typically an Assistant Deputy Minister.

## Compliance

Remember:

Inbound vs Outbound

------

The terms and conditions under which you will be distributing your software must not exceed the terms and conditions associated with the licences of the software you will be using in your project.
