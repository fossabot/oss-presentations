  * Find allies in places you did not think of (cities, provinces, civic society, private sector)
  * Find new usage for your software
    * AIA: Could be reused for Enterprise architecture assessments
  * Adopt best practices in development
    * Working in the open, you know other people will be able to see your code.
      * People are more prone to take the time to write better code.
* How can you do it?
  * Compliance
    * Choose your licence based on your desired outcome
    * Choose your licence based on the components you will be leveraging

## Why

Directive on Management of Information Technology

>C.2.3.8.4 All source code must be released under an appropriate open source software license

------

* Encourage [best coding practices](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/21/why-we-code-in-the-open/)
* It aligns with our goal of being an open government by releasing [data and information of value to citizens](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108#sec5.1).
* Find people with similar problems that could be interested in helping you [ORE](https://github.com/canada-ca/ore-ero)
* Find new usage to your software [AIA](https://github.com/canada-ca/aia-eia-js)

Let's start by creating a repository and uploading your project.

(Need instructions or we do live?)

Add a licence of your choice.

Which did you pick and why?

## Crown Copyright

Technically, the work we do in the office is Crown Copyright, it belongs to Her Majesty in right of Canada.

## Licence

The licence you choose has to be applied by someone with the delegated authority from the Crown.
